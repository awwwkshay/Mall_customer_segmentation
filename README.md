# Mall_customer_segmentation

In this project, We employed the below mentioned concepts and techniques to help a mall better understand its customers using segmentation.
We discussed and implemented a traditional approach to customer segmentation. Also explored and performed unsupervised machine learning (k-means clustering â€“ a commonly used, fast, and easily scalable clustering algorithm) for customer segmentation.
Also performed clustering on the data using multiple columns and did Dimensionality Reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

Used the file Mall_Customers.csv for the data.

Used libraries in Python: 
  Numpy
  Pandas
  Matplotlib
  Scikit-Learn
